### The Data of Lyrics:
## An Analysis of the Dynamicity of Music Lyrics Since 1965 and their Effects on Social Trends

In this research project, I sought to analyze the lyrics of the 100 most popular US songs from a 50-year span of time (1965-2015). Utilizing themes from natural language processing, I analyzed the lyrics of these 5000 songs. Analysis was split into three distinct sections, described below.

In section A of the writeup, I created a representative word cloud of each decade (1960s-2010s) using a z-score system to determine which lyrical terms *defined* each decade.

In section B, I show that the overall frequencies of song lyrics conform to Zipf's law.

In section C, I test the correlations between lyrical sentiments and real-world data in four sentimental categories (Positive, Negative, Financial, Violent). Using analyses of variance (ANOVA), I determined which relationships had significant correlations over the testing period.

This project was completed in late 2019, and I was elected to present this research at the Princeton University Mary W. George Research Conference.
